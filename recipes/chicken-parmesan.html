        <p><h1>Description</h1></p>
    
            <p>
                Crunchy chicken Parmesan that your family will love. 
                Everyone I have made this for has told me it's the best chicken Parmesan ever. 
                <P>
                Serve over your favorite pasta with your favorite sauce (I use marinara). 
                Sometimes I sprinkle mozzarella cheese over my chicken as well as the Parmesan. 
                I also garnish with chopped fresh basil.
